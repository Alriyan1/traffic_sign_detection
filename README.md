## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Webcam (for real-time detection)
- Sufficient lighting for better detection accuracy

### Required Packages

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
```

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Navigate** to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd trafficsigndetection
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: Create requirements.txt if not present)*

## 🎯 Usage

### Real-time Detection

Run the main script to start real-time traffic sign detection:

```bash
python trafficSign.py
```

**Controls:**
- **ESC key**: Exit the application
- **Webcam**: Point at traffic signs for detection

### Expected Output

The application will display:
- **Original Image**: Live camera feed with detection overlay
- **Class**: Detected traffic sign class (number + name)
- **Probability**: Confidence percentage (only shown if > 90%)

### Customization

You can modify these parameters in `trafficSign.py`:

```python
frameWidth = 640      # Camera resolution width
frameHeight = 480     # Camera resolution height
brightness = 180      # Camera brightness
threshold = 0.90      # Confidence threshold (90%)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Image Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Resize**: Convert to 32x32 pixels
2. **Grayscale**: Convert to single channel
3. **Histogram Equalization**: Enhance contrast
4. **Normalization**: Scale pixel values to [0,1]
5. **Reshape**: Prepare for model input (1,32,32,1)

### Model Architecture

### Key Functions

- `preprocess(img)`: Complete image preprocessing
- `getClassName(classNo)`: Convert class number to readable name
- `grayscale(img)`: Convert to grayscale
- `equalize(img)`: Apply histogram equalization

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Camera not working**
```bash
# Check camera permissions
# Ensure no other application is using the camera
```

**2. Model loading error**
```bash
# Verify model_trained.p exists in the directory
# Check file permissions
```

**3. Low detection accuracy**
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Hold traffic sign images clearly in camera view
- Check if camera is focused properly

**4. Import errors**
```bash
# Install missing packages
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow keras
```

**5. Performance issues**
- Reduce camera resolution in the script
- Close other applications using camera
- Ensure sufficient system resources

### Performance Tips

- **Good Lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting for better detection
- **Stable Camera**: Keep camera steady for accurate results
- **Clear Signs**: Use clear, unobstructed traffic sign images
- **Optimal Distance**: Maintain appropriate distance from camera

## 🎮 Interactive Demo

Try these traffic signs with your camera:

1. **Speed Limit Signs**: Hold up printed speed limit signs
2. **Stop Signs**: Use a red octagonal stop sign
3. **Yield Signs**: Show triangular yield signs
4. **Warning Signs**: Display various warning symbols

**Pro Tip**: Print traffic sign images and hold them in front of the camera for testing!
